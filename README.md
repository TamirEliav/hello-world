# hello-world
Learn how to use GutHub :)

This is my first project I'm using Git.
I used to work with Mercurial so far, let's see how it goes... :)

I have cloned the repo in my using MATLAB
Let's try to commit this change!

I managed to commit and push my previous comment to GitHub repo!!
Let's find out if commit was to the LOCAL repo (Git) and the push did the update in GitHub!

To avoid re entering the username / password each time, I'm using the git wrapper for MATLAB.
The git wrapper is using the git installed in my PC to communicate with GitHub, and it has my credinals....
There is another option to solve this (and use the build-in MATLAB interface), which is to use SSH, but that seems to much effort...
